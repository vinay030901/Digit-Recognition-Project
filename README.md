## Deploy a PyTorch model using Flask & Heroku

Create and Deploy your first Deep Learning app! In this PyTorch tutorial we learn how to deploy our PyTorch model with Flask and Heroku.
We create a simple Flask app with a REST API that returns the result as json data, and then we deploy it to Heroku. As an example PytTorch app we do digit classification, and at the end I show you how I draw my own digits and then predict it with our live running app.
